### ActionMenuUtils v2.0.0
- Mod now depends on ActionMenuApi & UIExpansionKit, this just makes maintaining it easier for me when/if something breaks
- New setting added that you can enable so you can now select which avatar you want to reset into. You can select avatar by going to the AvatarMenu and clicking the UIExpansionKit button on the left

### StandaloneThirdPerson v1.3.0
- Fixed issue with mod not showing when not launching through steam (--no-vr)
- Added secondary keybinds for third person toggle and freeform toggle, you can leave these as `None` or set them to `LeftControl` for example
- Added a setting to enable/disable freeform
